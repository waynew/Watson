Watson
======

|Build Status| |PyPI Downloads Per Month| |PyPI Latest Version|

Watson is here to help you monitoring your time. You want to know how
much time you are spending on your projects? You want to generate a nice
report for your client? Watson is here for you.

Tell Watson when you start working on a task with the ``start`` command.
Then, when you are done with this task, stop the timer with the ``stop``
command. This will create what we call a **frame**. That's pretty much
everything you need to know to start using Watson.

Each frame consists of the name of a project and some tags. Your tags
can be shared across projects and can be used to generate detailed
reports.

Watson stores everything on your computer, but you can go wild and use
`artich.io <https://artich.io/?pk_campaign=GitHubWatson>`__ to store
your sessions remotely and share it with your colleagues.

Install
-------

Watson is available on any platform supported by Python (Windows, Mac,
Linux, \*BSDâ€¦). The easiest way to install it is to use
`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install td-watson

You might need to run this command as root in order to install Watson
globally.

Alternatively, you can choose to install Watson for your user only by
running:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install --user td-watson

If after this the ``watson`` command is not available, you need to add
``~/.local/bin/`` to your PATH. If your terminal is Bash, you can do
this by running:

.. code:: bash

    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc  # Add ~/.local/bin/ to your .bashrc PATH

and restarting your terminal session or sourcing the ``.bashrc``:

.. code:: bash

    $ source ~/.bashrc  # Reload your .bashrc

Development version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The latest development version can be installed using the following
commands:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson.git
    $ cd Watson/
    $ python setup.py install

Command line completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use a Bash-compatible shell, you can install the
``watson.completion`` file from the source distribution as
``/etc/bash.completion.d/watson`` - or wherever your distribution keeps
the Bash completion configuration files. After you restart your shell,
you can then just type ``watson`` on your command line and then hit TAB
to see all available commands. Depending on your input, it completes
watson commands, command options, projects, tags and frame IDs.

Commands
--------

Here is the listing of all the commands available with Watson. You can
also find this help with ``watson help``.

start
~~~~~

Start monitoring the time for the given project. You can add tags
indicating more specifically what you are working on with '+tag'.

If there is already a running project and the configuration option
``stop_on_start`` is set to a true value (``'1'``, ``'on'``, ``'true'`` or
``'yes'``), it is stopped before the new project is started.

::

    Example :
    $ watson start apollo11 +module +brakes
    Starting apollo11 [module, brakes] at 16:34

stop
~~~~

Stop monitoring time for the current project

::

    $ watson stop
    Stopping project apollo11, started a minute ago. (id: e7ccd52)

cancel
~~~~~~

Cancel the last call to the start command. The time will not be
recorded.

status
~~~~~~

Display when the current project was started and the time spent since.

You can configure how the date and time of when the project was started
are displayed by setting ``options.date_format`` and
``options.time_format`` in the configuration. The syntax of these
formatting strings and the supported placeholders are the same as for
the ``strftime`` method of Python's
`datetime.datetime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior>`__
class.

::

    $ watson status
    Project apollo11 [brakes] started seconds ago (2014-05-19 14:32:41+0100)
    $ watson config options.date_format %d.%m.%Y
    $ watson config options.time_format "at %I:%M %p"
    $ watson status
    Project apollo11 [brakes] started a minute ago (19.05.2014 at 02:32 PM)

report
~~~~~~

Display a report of the time spent on each project.

If a project is given, the time spent on this project is printed. Else,
print the total for each root project.

By default, the time spent the last 7 days is printed. This timespan can
be controlled with the ``--from`` and ``--to`` arguments. The dates must
have the format ``YEAR-MONTH-DAY``, like: ``2014-05-19``.

You can limit the report to a project or a tag using the ``--project``
and ``--tag`` options. They can be specified several times each to add
multiple projects or tags to the report.

The ``$EDITOR`` environment variable is used to detect your editor.

remove
~~~~~~

Remove a frame.

config
~~~~~~

Get and set configuration options.

If value is not provided, the content of the key is displayed. Else, the
given value is set.

You can edit the configuration file with an editor with the '--edit'

    $ watson config backend.token
    7e329263e329

sync
~~~~

Get frames from the server and push the new ones.

**Warning:** this feature is still experimental and not yet publicly
available.

    In a near future, you will be able to sync Watson with your
    `artich.io <https://artich.io/?pk_campaign=GitHubWatson>`__ account
    or any compatible third-party back-end.

The URL of the server and the User Token must be defined in your
`configuration file <#configuration>`__ or with the
`config <#config>`__ command.

::

    $ watson config backend.url http://localhost:4242
    $ watson config backend.token 7e329263e329
    $ watson sync
    Received 42 frames from the server
    Pushed 23 frames to the server

Configuration
-------------

The configuration and the data are stored inside your user's application
folder.

On Mac, this is ``~/Library/Application Support/watson/config``, on
Windows this is ``C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\watson\config`` and on
Linux ``~/.config/watson/config``.

If you want to edit your configuration, the best is to use the
`config <#config>`__ command.

Deleting all your frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to remove all your frames, you can delete the ``frames``
file in your configuration folder (see above to find its location).
